# Electronic tools for PCB (printed circuit board).
COMPLETE LIST OF PCB MAKING TOOLS 
1. PCB DESIGN SOFTWARE
   (Before making the board)
● KiCad
Free, open-source PCB design             software.
Used to draw circuit schematic and       PCB layout.
Good for beginners and advanced         users.

● Eagle
Popular PCB design tool by Autodesk.
Simple UI, good for small to medium projects.

● Altium Designer
Professional-level software.
Used in industry; powerful but expensive.

●EasyEDA
Online and free.
Very easy for beginners and directly connects to PCB manufacturers.


2. PCB FABRICATION TOOLS (Making the copper tracks)
There are 3 ways
1. UV method
2. Toner transfer
3. CNC milling


3. SOLDERING TOOLS (After the PCB is made)
1. Soldering Iron (25W–60W)
Used to melt solder and attach components to the PCB.

2. Solder Wire
The metal that melts and connects components electrically.

3. Flux Paste
Makes soldering smoother, prevents oxidation.

4. Soldering Stand
Holds hot soldering iron safely.

5. Solder Wick
Absorbs extra solder (for corrections).

6. Desoldering Pump
Removes solder when you want to fix mistakes.

7. Hot Air Rework Station
Used for SMD components (small chips).

Blows hot air to melt solder without touching the board.

8. Tweezers
Holds tiny components while soldering.

9. PCB Holder / Helping Hands
Holds PCB in place when soldering.

10. Heat Resistant Mat
Protects table from heat.


4. ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY & TESTING TOOLS
1. Side Cutter
Cuts component legs and wires.

2. Needle Nose Pliers
Bends and holds wires/components.

3. Wire Stripper
Removes insulation from wires.

4. Multimeter
Tests voltage, current, resistance, continuity.

5. Bench Power Supply
Gives fixed and adjustable voltage to test the PCB.

6. Magnifying Glass / Microscope
Helps check tiny solder joints.

7. Component Tester (LCR Meter)
Tests inductors, capacitors, resistors.
